<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* I need to create an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and React.
* There will be no back-end in this project, so I will need to incorporate the products for sale on this site using a json file.
* I need to identify what this site will be selling.(Records)
* I need to create a good flow and style that allows for easy transition from route to route.
* Main problems to solve:
    - Need to store products for the e-commerce site within the application
    - Need to display a store front
    - Need to display products page
    - Need to display product info
    - Need to have the functionality to add products to a shopping cart
    - Need to be able to view shopping cart
    - Need to have functionality to check out from shopping cart
    - Need to refresh an empty shopping cart once a user has checked out
* The unknown variables are:
    - the products I will be displaying(records)
    - where I am storing the products to display on the site(json file)
    - how to integrate a method to checkout
* I believe I will be able to store the products in a json file in my application, and then display product information from that location.
* I will have to look up documentation and watch some videos about integrating a checkout method like paypal, venmo, or stripe. Ultimately I will be updating the object in the json file as well when a checkout occurs - so I know there will be some logic coming from a functional component when I need to integrate the checkout functionality.(Anna posted reference videos in the resource channel on Slack from DEV and YouTube about integrating PayPal)

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* I will spend my first day of working on the Capstone thinking and planning.
* I copied the template from github into my own repository,  cloned the repository to my local machine, created and switched to a new branch called Christopher-Jones.
* I have made a kanban board that includes every requirement from the readme.md, and I add to the board as new ideas come to me during this planning stage.
* I will spend time looking over other e-commerce sites to see what functionality they have, and see if the flow of their applications will be something that would be beneficial to pull inspiration from when creating my own flow.
* I will look at Figma and see if I can use this resource to help start this project with a solid wireframe to use as a visual tool to keep it in my mind that there is a bigger picture with this application.
* I have resources that I will need to utilize once I get into the coding. I will use Dev Ed and Traversy videos from both YouTube and Udemy to help me with the newer concepts I've learned in React.
* I will try to plan "mini sprints" which will be a day long, but I will try to complete a certain number of tasks for each "mini sprint" to be sure I will be completely done with this application by the time it comes to present.
* "Mini Sprint" Schedule:
    - Monday: Planning/Wireframe
    - Tuesday: Create React Application/Create Routes & Product Storage File
    - Wednesday: Create Products Page & Products Detail Page
    - Thursday: Create Shopping Cart Page & Checkout Functionality
    - Friday: Implement Search Bar
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* I have a good idea of what this assignment is requiring, and the planning portion is going very well.
* I will complete a wireframe to have a general guideline of what I want the application to look like, and I have done this before on other applications so I feel confident that I can complete this with no blockers.
* I will set up my React app, get the routes working, and set up a json file storage system. I have set up other React applications that incorporated routes, and I feel confident I can do this with no blockers. I have not set up json file storage before, and I may have some blockers when trying to do this. If I encounter any blocker swith calling my json file storage system to display it's data in my application I will reach out to my TM Matthew and classmates if I can't find any fixes with google or React Doc's.
* Once I have the previous steps in place I will be able to create a products page and a product details page fairly easily. I have done this in non-react applications before, and I feel confident that I will be able to transfer the data where I need it to go with little to no blockers.
* The shopping cart page is where I think my blockers will become more challenging. I haven't become as familiar with the functional components as I would like to be, and I think I will have some blockers when I try to add products to my shopping cart, and remove them from my product inventory. I think it will be similar to creating CRUD components like I have done in other applications so I am hoping that knowledge will translate to this application, but if I encounter major blockers with this then I will reach out to my TM and classmates if I can't find any fixes with google or React Doc's.
* I am expecting to have some major blockers with the checkout functionality as I have never attempted integrating this feature into an of my previous applications. I will have some Doc's and videos ready to go when I get to this portion, and if I can't find any fixes then I will reach out to my TM and classmates.
* I have practiced creating a search bar when I was following a React API tutorial by Dev Ed on YouTube. I am not familiar with doing this on my own so I imagine I will have some blockers when I get to this point, but I have some videos I can reference as well as previous code to try and get fixes. If I have blockers for too long and can't get fixes from google or tutorials then I will reach out to my classmates and my TM.
* Once I have all of the functionality in place and all of my features working appropriately without breaking my application I will work on setting up a style them that enhances the user experience and delivers a good transitional flow that excites users to spend money. I am fairly comfortable with styling, but I may encounter some blockers as I am still getting used to styling with components instead of HTML.
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* I don't necessarily think I will have much time to reflect or refactor my code, but I will spend time trying to make sure that all of my features work without breaking.
* I will try to use all of the features in my application, and then I will have a family member try to use my application and get their feedback.
* I would love to refactor my code into a clean streamlined file, but if I get all the functionality and features in place and working appropriately then there is a pretty good chance I will not touch it again. I have a tendency to break my applications when I try to refactor my code in previous assignments, and I am mainly shooting for working code here.
* There are certain areas I feel more comfortable with refactoring, and I will spend some time cleaning up each file, and making it easier to understand for other developers with comments and easy to figure out variable/function names.
